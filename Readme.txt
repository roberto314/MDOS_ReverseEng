24.1 Diskette Structure

Information on an MDOS diskette is stored in sectors 128(decimal) bytes in size. 
As the diskette turns, the read/write head in a stationary position will
pass over 26 (decimal) sectors each revolution. The head can be
positioned over 77 (decimal) discrete cylinders. Thus, there
are a total of 2002 (decimal) sectors on each surface of a diskette.
In order to minimize access time and yet provide for a dynamic allocation scheme, 
all diskette space allocation is done in terms of clusters rather than sectors.
MDOS clusters consist of four physically sequential sectors.
A cluster is the smallest structural unit of information on the diskette. Thus, the
smallest possible size that a file can have is one cluster.

MDOS accesses sectors on the diskette via a physical sector number (PSN).
The diskette controller decodes the PSN into the appropriate cylinder/sector position.

A portion of each diskette is reserved for some special system tables.
These tables reside in the outermost cylinder of the diskette, cylinder zero.
Each table, with the exception of the directory. occupies a single sector.
The following table summarizes the location of the system tables:

24.1.1 Diskette Identification Block

The Diskette Identification Block is created during system generation.
It contains an 10. the version and revision number of the resident operating system,
the date the diskette was generated, a user name identification area, and a dynamic 
area for the MDOS overlay RIB addresses. The ID is displayed by the DIR, 
FREE, and REPAIR commands. The Diskette Identification Block has the following formatat:

Bytes Size Contents
HEX           
0-7    8   Diskette ID
8-9    2   Verion Nr.
A-B    2   Revision Nr.
C-11   6   Generation Date
12-25  14  User Name
26-39  14  MDOS Overlay RIB Addresses
3A-7F  46  Zeroes

24.1.2 Cluster Allocation Table

The Cluster Allocation Table (CAT) contains a bit map of the areas on the diskette 
that are available for new space allocation. Each bit in the CAT represents a 
pnysical cluster of diskette storage. The first bit of the first byte of the 
CAT (bit 7 of byte 0) represents cluster 0. The subsequent bits represent subsequent clusters. A bit set to one indicates that the cluster is allocated. If a bit is set
to zero, it indicates that the corresponding cluster is available for allocation. 
Since not all 128 bytes of the CAT correspond to physical clusters, the parts of 
the CAT that represent clusters beyond the physical end of the diskette are 
marked as allocated so that they cannot be used by any MOOS functions.

On single-sided diskettes, bytes 0-$3E of the CAT correspond to the physical 
locations on the diskette; however, in byte S3E, bits 0-3 are set to one since 
no physical sectors correspond to those cluster numbers. Bytes $3F-7F are set to 
all ones. The cluster division for allocation only includes 2000 (decimal) sectors. 
Since there are 2002 sectors, the last two physical sectors of a single-sided diskette 
are not available for allocation ($7D0 - 7D1).

On double-sided diskettes, bytes 0-$7D correspond to the physical locations on the 
diskette; however, in byte $7D, bits 0-6 are set to one since no physical sectors
correspond to those cluster numbers. Bytes $7E and $7F are set to all ones.
The cluster division for allocation includes all physical sectors (4004, decimal).
There are no unused sectors on a double-sided diskette.

24.1.3 Lockout Cluster Allocation Table

The Lockout Cluster Allocation Table, or LCAT, is similar to the CAT in structure;
however, it is only used during the DOSGEN and REPAIR processes. The LCAT provides a
map of which areas of the diskette have been flagged as bad during the DOSGEN write/read test. In addition, the LCAT is configured so that those sectors of the diskette 
occupied by the system tables in cylinder zero and any user locked out areas 
(see Chapter 10, DOSGEN command) are flaqged as unavailable for normal allocation.

24.1.4 Directory

The directory occupies twenty sectors. Each directory sector contains eight entries 
of sixteen bytes each. Each entry contains a file name, a suffix, the address of the
file's first cluster, the file's attributes, and some room for expansion.

A file is one or more clusters containing related information. This information may 
be ASCII source programs, binary object records, user-generated data, etc. Each
file must reside wholly on a single diskette. Files are identified to the system 
by their names, suffixes, and logical unit numbers. 

The name as stored in the directory consists of ten bytes; however the MOOS command interpreter deals with an eight-byte name and,a tWO-byte suffix. This is merely a convention of the command interpreter and has no significance in relation to the 
internal format of the directory. System routines and functions dealing with file 
names as a parameter use a ten-byte block which is always dealt with as a monolithic
item.

File names assigned by the user must be from one to eight alphanumeric characters 
in length. The first character must be alphabetic. A file's suffix is used to further
identify the file. The suffix is primarily used to identify the format of the file
content; however, this is purely a convention; the attribute field of the directory 
entry describes the file's physical format. Suffixes are considered as an extension 
of the file name. They can be one or two alphanumeric characters in lenqth.
The first character of the suffix must be alphabetic. Both the file name and the 
suffix, if shorter than their maximum allowable lengths, are left justified and space-filled in the directory entry.

In most cases, the MOOS commands make certain default assumptions about a file's 
suffix if it is not explicitly specified by the operator; however, explicit 
suffixes can be used whenever the default is to be overridden. The standard
MOOS default suffixes are:

Suffix Implied meaning

AL     Assembly listinq file
CF     Chain procedural file
CM     Command file file
ED     EDOS-converted file
LO     Loadable, memory-image file
LX     EXbug-loadable file
RO     Relocatable object file
SA     ASCII source file
SY     Internally-used system file


In addition to a name, each directory entry contains a set of attributes which
characterize the file's content. A file's attributes include inherent attributes 
and assignable attributes. The inherent attributes of a file describe its
allocation scheme (contiguous or segmented), the file format (ASCII record, 
binary record, memory-image, or user-defined), and whether space compression
is used for ASCII records. The file formats are described in section 24.3.

The assignable attributes include write protection, delete protection, and the 
system file attribute. If a file is write protected, it cannot be written into 
or deleted. If a file is delete protected, it cannot be deleted. If a file
has the system attribute, it will be included in the system Generation process 
(DOSGEN) and is handled differently by the DEL and DIR commands.

The format of a directory following table:

Bytes Size Contents
HEX
0-7    8   File name
8-9    2   Suffix
A-B    2   PSN of first cluster
C-D    2   Attributes
E-F    2   Zeroes

The attribute field of a directory has the following format:
F  E  D  C  B  A  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  <---- not used (=0) ---->
|  |  |  |  |     |___ File Format (0 = user defined,
|  |  |  |  |  ?                    2 = memory-image,
|  |  |  |  |                       3 = binary record,
|  |  |  |  |                       5 = ASCII record,
|  |  |  |  |                       7 = ASCII-converted binary record)
|  |  |  |  |   
|  |  |  |  |_ Non-compressed space bit                    
|  |  |  |____ Contiguous allocation bit
|  |  |_______ System file bit
|  |__________ Delete protection bit
|_____________ Write protection bit

Associated with each directory entry is an eiqht-bit number, the directory 
entry number (DEN), which is a function of the physical location of the entry 
within the directory. [he DEN is not found anywhere in the directory. It is a
calculated quantity and is interpreted as follows:

  7 6 5 4 3   2 1 0
---------------------
|           |       |
---------------------
      ^         ^
      |         |___ Position within sector (0-7)
      |_____________ Physical Sector Number ($03-$16)


24.1.5 Bootblock

The Bootblock is a small loader program that is brought into memory along with 
the next physical sector by the diskette controller during system initialization. 
The second sector that is loaded contains information regarding the size of the 
resident operating system. From this information, the Bootblack program configures
the diskette controller to load into memory the actual resident operating system.

24.2 File Structure

While the contents of a file can be thought of as a logically contiguous block of
information, the actual diskette area allocated to the file mayor may not be
physically contiguous. Space can be allocated to one or more groups of physically
contiguous clusters on the diskette. each contiguous group of clusters is called a
segment. This segmentation allows the dynamic allocation and deallocation of space
to occur without having to move any of the information contained in the file or in 
other files. 
Each file must, therefore, have a table that describes which segments are allocated 
to the file. This table is kept in the first physical sector of each file and is 
called the Retrieval Information Block (RIB). It is the address of the RIB that is
contained in the directory entry of a file.

MDOS accesses sectors within a file by logical sector number (LSN). Since the first
physical sector of a file is not really a data sector, the RIB is given an LSN of
minus one (SFFFF). Therefore, logical sector zero of a file (the first data sector) 
is actually the second physical sector of the file. Logical sector numbers for data
sectors are numbered sequentially beginning with zero. Thus, even though a file may
be segmented (not physically contiguous on the diskette), it is treated as a 
logically contiguous collection of sectors when accessed by logical sector number. 
The system I/O functions decode the LSN into the actual PSN.

24.2.1 Retrieval Information Block

For all files, the RIB contains a series of two-byte entries called segment 
descriptor words (SDWs). A special SDW is used as a terminator to indicate the end 
of the segment descriptors within the RIB. Each SDW (other than the terminator) 
contains two pieces of information: the cluster number of the first cluster in the
segment, and the length of the segment. Since each segment consists of physically
contiguous clusters, this information is all that is needed to describe where a segment 
of the file is located on the diskette. A RIB can contain a maximum of 57 ($39) SDWs
and one terminator.

The RIB of a memory-image file contains some adiitional information that describes 
where the contents of the file are to be loaded in memory. This information includes 
the starting I01d address, the number of sectors to load, the number of bytes in the 
last sector, and the starting execution address.

The memory-image file load information is described in the following paragraphs. Both 
the content and the location of each field are described. The offsets used to refer 
to the various bytes are relative to zero (zero being the first byte of the RIS sector).

1. Byte 117 ($75), the number of bytes to load from the last sector, must be non-zero, 
   a multiple of 8, and less than or equal to 128 (S80).
2. Bytes 118-119 ($76,77), the number of sectors to load, must contain a number that 
   is non-zero, less than the total number of sectors allocated to the file, and less 
   than or equal to 512 ($200).
3. Bytes 120-121 ($78,79), the starting load address, are not checked. For programs
   loadinq in an EXORciser I system, in the User Memory Map of an EXORciser II 
   system with the single memory map configured, or in the Executive Memory Map of 
   an EXORciser II system with the dual memory map configured, this value must be 
   greater than hexadecimal location $1F if the program is to be loaded via the 
   MDOS loader. EXORiciser II systems can have programs loaded into the User Memory 
   Map of the dual memory map configuration starting at location zero.
4. The ending load address is calculated from bytes 117-121 in the following manner:
         EL = (NSL - 1) * 128 + NBLS + SL - 1
   where EL is the ending load address, NSL is the number of sectors to load (bytes
   118-119), NBLS is the number of bytes in the last sector (byte 117), and SL is
   the starting load address (bytes 120-12). The ending load address must be less 
   than 65536.
5. Bytes 122-123 ($7A,7B), the starting execution address, must lie within the range 
   of addresses spanned by the file (greater than or equal to the starting load 
   address, and less than or equal to the ending load address).
6. Bytes 124-127 are not used and must be zero.

The following diagrams illustrate the segment descriptor word and the terminator.

SEGMENT DESCRIPTOR WORD

|  <-- Logical Sector nr. of logical EOF ---->
|__ One (Terminator bit)

The SDW terminator is used to monitor the logical end-of-file. It contains the logical
sector number of the end-of-file. The sector which is the end of a file may be
partially filled with null characters. Thus, no actual end-of-file record will be found
within a file. This feature allows files to be merged toqether without having to read
through the entire file looking for an end-of-file record. 
The actual format of a RIB is shown in the following diagram. For non-memory-imaqe 
files, the bytes following the terminator must all be zero. Only memory-image files 
can have non-zero bytes following the terminator, and then those bytes must meet the 
six criteria listed above.

24.2.2 File formats

MDOS deals with four types of file formats on diskette: user-defined, memory-image, 
binary record, and ASCII record. 
User-defined files are dealt with by MDOS at the sector level. MDOS will keep track of where the file is and will only allow access to the file by logical sector number. The user has the responsibility of formatting the data within the sectors in the manner 
suited to his application.

Memory-image files include all files whose contents are to be loaded into memory directly from the diskette by the MDOS loader. Memory-imaqe files are allocated contiguous
space on the diskette. The only information retained about where the content is to be
loaded is kept in the file's RIB. The data within the sectors of the file contain 
no load or record information. It is merely an imaqe of a block of memory to be loaded
into. Due to the nature of the diskette controller, MDOS programs can only be loaded in
multiples of eight bytes. A further restriction placed on memory-image files is that 
their content cannot load below memory location $20 if they are to reside in the single
memory map of an EXORciser I or EXORciser II system.

Binary record files are used primarily for the relocatable object datA produced by the
Macro Assembler and the relocatable FORTRAN compiler; however, the user can create data
files usinq this binary record format as well.

ASCII record files are used to contain all other MDOS-supported data. Such files can be 
in either space-compressed or non-space-compressed form. Normally, MDOS will always
create ASCII files with the space-compression attribute to conserve diskette space.

The non-memory-image files can be allocated in either contiguous or segmented fashion.
Normally, MDOS will create such files in a segmented manner to take advantage of the
dynamic allocation scheme. If files are segmented, they can expand to the full capacity 
of the diskette when they need to grow in size; however, if files have contiquously
allocated space. then they can only be expanded if they are allocated space that is
contiguous to the originally allocate1 space. Normally, contiguous files are created 
with the maximum space that they will ever need.

24.3 Record Structure

This section describes in detail the two record types supported for diskette files.
In addition, a special record type used fot COpying binary files to a non-diskette
device is also discussed. fhe actual use of such records is fully discussed in 
Chapter 25 which describes the supported I/O functions. All records supported by MOOS 
are terminated by a carriage return, line feed, and null sequence; however, on
the diskette, only the carriage return character is retained in order to conserve 
diskette space. When diskette files are copied to a non-diskette device, the other 
two characters are automatically supplied by MOOS.

24.3.1 Binary records

Binary records are used primarily as output from the Macro Assembler and the FORTRAN
compiler, and for input to the Linking Loader. Binary records contain a special record
header, a byte count, and a checksum. The checksum is a two's-complemented sum of 
all bytes in the record from the byte count through the last data byte, inclusive. 
A maximum of 254 (decimal) data bytes can be contained in each binary record.

The format of a binary record can be illustrated as:

 --------------------//-------------
| D | BC |     DATA       | CK | CR |
 --------------------//-------------

The symbols take on the following meanings:

Symbol     Meaning
------    ---------
  D       The binary record header character "D" ($44).
  BC      A one byte "byte count" contains the number of data
          Bytes in the record plus one (for checksum).
  DATA    A maximum of 254 (dec.) data bytes. Any eight-bit values are 
          valid for the data bytes.
  CK      The two's-complemented sum of the byte count and all data bytes. 
          CK is a one byte field.
  CR      The terminatinq carriage return. For non-diskette devices this 
          will actually be a carriage return, line feed, and null sequence.

Since diskette files contain the logical end-of-file indicator in the RIB, the 
binary EOF record only will be seen on non-diskette devices. The binary EOF 
record has the following format:

 ------------------
| E | BC | CK | CR |
 ------------------

The symbol "E" is the end-ot-file record header which is the letter "E" ($45). 
The other symbols are the same as in the above table. The EOF record has no 
data bytes. Thus, the byte count will be equal to one.

24.3.2 ASCII records

ASCII records are used primarily for source files on the diskette; however, 
EXbug-loadable format files are ASCII even though they are object files output 
from the assemblers or Linking Loader.

ASCII records contain no record headers, byte counts, or checksum fields. The 
first ASCII record in a file begins with the first data character of a file and 
is terminated by the first carriage return. All other ASCII records in the
file begin with the first data character following a carriage return. When 
ASCII records are copied to non-diskette devices, the terminating carriage return 
is actually a combination of three control characters: carriage return,
line feed and null. ASCII records should contain only displayable characters.

When MOOS writes ASCII records to diskette, they normally contain space compression
characters to conserve diskette space. A space compression character is indicated
by a data byte having the sign bit (bit 7) set to a one. The remaining bits (O-6) 
contain a binary number representing the number of spaces ($20) to be inserted in 
place of the compressed character. MDOS automatically expands these characters into 
spaces when such files are read. MDOS will also automatically create these compressed
characters when such tiles are written. 

Since MDOS maintains the loqical end-at-file indicator in a file's RIB, no ASCII 
EOF record will be seen in a diskette file; however, when ASCII record files are 
written to a non-diskette device, the following EOF record will be supplied:

 --------
| 1A | CR |
 --------

where the "1A" symbol represents the end-of-file indicator. It is the hexadecimal 
value $1A or SUB control character (CTL-Z). The CH symbol is the carriage return, 
line feed, and null sequence.

If ASCII record files generated on another system are to be processed by MDOS, it 
is important that the carriage return, line feed. and null sequence be present at 
the end of each record. Otherwise, it is possible for each data record to lose 
one or two characters from its beginning.


24.3.3 ASCII-converted-binary records

A special form of the binary record exists when copying to a non-diskette device 
that can only accept seven-bit data. This record format is usually never kept in 
a diskette file. fhe format of the ASCII-converted-binary record is identical
to the binary record; however, each byte, with the exception of the special header
character and the terminating carriage return, line feed, and null sequence, is 
converted into two eight-bit bytes with bit seven set to zero. This is
accomplished by taking each half of the original byte and adding the bit mask 
%00110000 to the half-byte. The result is a displayable two-byte sequence. For
example, the hexadecimal data byte $85 would be converted into the two byte 
sequence $38 and $35.

24.3.4 File descriptor records

MDOS I/0 operations with non-diskette devices can be in one of two modes: file 
format or non-file format. The non-file format mode requires no special processing 
and uses only the ASCII record format.

The file format mode allows MDOS to treat the data on certain non-diskette devices 
as a "file", similar to a file on diskette. The File Descriptor Record (FDR) is 
employed to serve the same function as a directory entry for a diskette file. 
The FDR contains a file name, suffix, and a file format descriptor. Thus, MDOS
can search for a named file on a cassette or paper tape, if it was originally 
created using the file format mode.

All FDRs are identical in format, reqardless of the record format of the data file.
Since the FDR must be acceptable to any Device, it is written in the ASCII-converted-binary form, even if the remaining data of the file is in binary 
or ASCII. The FDR format is shown in the following diagram:

 ------------------------------------------------
| H | BC | NAME | SUFX | NU | FDF | NU | CK | CR |
 ------------------------------------------------

The symbols take on the followinq meaninqs:

Symbol     Meaning
------    ---------
  H       The FDR header character "H" ($48).
  BC      A one byte "byte count" contains the number of bytes in 
          all fields from NAME through CK, inclusive. This number is
          fixed for FDR records at 17 (dec.). This number reflects the real 
          data bytes in the unconverted binary form, not the bytes written in 
          the ASClI-converted-binary form.
  NAME    The eight-character file name
  SUFX    The two-character suffix.
  NU      A two-byte field which is not used. It contains zeroes.
  FDF     A two-byte field similar in format to the attribute field of a 
          directory entry. Only bits $8-$A are used to describe the file format.
  CK      The two's-complemented sum of the byte count and all data bytes. 
          CK is a one byte field.
  CR      The terminating character sequence of carriage return, line feed, and null.

The length of all fields of the FDR (except H and CR) is doubled when written 
(ASCII-converted-binary format). Thus, if the CR field is counted as three characters 
(carriage return, line feed, null), then the physical length of an FDR in the 
ASClI-converted-binary format is 36 (decimal) bytes.

24.4 System Files


On every MDOS diskette there are nine files which comprise the operating system.
These files contain the resident operating system, a series of overlays to reduce 
the main memory requirements of the system, and standard error messaqes. The 
resident operating system file MDOS.SY must reside in a fixed place on the 
diskette if the Bootblock program is to work after being activated by the Diskette
controller. The other system files must remain in fixed positions after MDOS has 
been initialized since they are referenced by their physical sector numbers.


24.4.1 System overlays

The system overlay files are loaded into memory into one of the four overlay regions
discussed in the subsequent section. The overlay handler only brings an overlay into
memory if it is not already in memory at the time a specific function is required.
If an overlay remains in memory, access to its function is faster than if it has be 
to loaded from the diskette. The functions contained in the seven overlay files are 
shown in the following table:


 Overlay      Function

MDOSOV0.SY   Diskette space allocation and deallocation.
MDOSOV1.SY   Processing standard file names, allocating contiguous memory, reserving
             a device, releasing a device, writing standard records, writing FDRs, 
             writing End-of-file records, console reader / punch device handling.
MDOSOV2.SY   Reaing standrd records, reading FDRs.
MDOSOV3.SY   Closing a file / device, rewinding diskette files, changing file names
             and attributes.
MDOSOV4.SY   Opening a file / device.
MDOSOV5.SY   Chain file execution.
MDOSOV6.SY   Command line interpretation.

When MDOS is initialized, the directory is searched for the seven overlays by name. 
The physical diskette addresses are then retained so that a subsequent reference to 
an overlay function does not involve another directory search. Thus, MDOS must be
reinitialized each time the diskette in drive zero is changed so that the overlays 
can be located again.

Overlays MOOSOVO and MDOSOV1 use overlay region one. Overlays MDOSOV2 and MDOSOV3 use overlay region two. Overlays MDOSOV4 and MDOSOV5 use overlay region three, and
overlay MDOSOV6 uses the User Program Area into which the MDOS commands also are loaded. The overlay regions are shown in the memory map diagram of section 24.5.

24.4.2 System error message file

In an attempt to use English language descriptions for the various error conditions 
that may arise, all standard error messages are kept in the-system file MOOSER.SY. 
This file is accessed by the error message function .MDERR (section 27.4).
The error messages are placed in this file so that the most frequently used messages 
are near the beginning.

If the error message file cannot be read or accessed, the error message function will
display a message injicatinq that an invalid error message has been requested.

24.5 Memory Map

Locations s0000-001F, inclusive, are reserved for the variables of the diskette
controller. These locations cannot be initialized by a program loading from the 
diskette. In addition, if a program requires the use of the diskette functions 
(either directly through the diskette controller or through the MOOS functions), 
then these locations cannot be used by the program for storage. Locations 
$00AE - 00FD, inclusive, contain the MOOS command line as it was entered by the 
operator. Command~interpreter-loadable programs must load above location $1FFF.
They can use the direct addressing area for variable storage; however, this Area
cannot be initialized while the program is being loaded into memory. Programs 
that do not make use of MDOS system functions can load anywhere in memory above 
location $001F. If such programs do not use the diskette controller entry points
(Appendix D), the direct addressing area below location $0020 can be used, but 
only after the proqram is resident in memory.
